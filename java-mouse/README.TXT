PROJECT TITLE: Rat Maze
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Implementing Prim's Algorithm to generate a random n x n size maze. Pseudocode was provided by the University of Auckland.
VERSION or DATE: 10.8.2014 v0.1
UPDATE 7.10.2014 v0.1.1 - Changed implementation of Maze storage
AUTHORS: Sana Oshika
USER INSTRUCTIONS: Currently it only runs using the custom ecs100 library for Victoria University first
year classes. Top of the to-do list is to change the implementation to use JFrames so it is universal.

Other things to-do: 
Implement hashcode in the Cell class to make .contains() work properly, then refactor.
Add a toggle to leave a trail.
Implement arrow keys instead of WASD.
Add cheese
Implement a score system
